#Setup

 2. Clone this repo. `git clone https://github.com/J-Fricke/saltyVagrantNodeJs.git`
 3. `cd` into directory you cloned into.
 4. `mkdir /web` on your host or edit Vagrantfile to point to where you wish to share file with the host.
 5. Edit configVars.yaml with the name of your app and the directory you want to host your node apps. Can leave either of these as is.
